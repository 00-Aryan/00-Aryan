• Beginner-friendly machine learning projects  
• Data analysis tasks & model experimentation  

🤔 I’m looking for help with  
• Better ways to structure ML projects  
• Improving problem-solving & clean code habits  

💬 Ask me about  
• Python, Flask basics, DS fundamentals  
• My recommender system or quiz web app project
